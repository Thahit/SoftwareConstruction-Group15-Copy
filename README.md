# UZH HS2020 - Software Construction
Copy of the Repository used for the module Software Construction. The Group consists of Seouless29, MESC2020, and Thahit(me)<br>
The original Repository is invisible because durring the Module other teams could have looked at it. Some of the statistics of that version are bugged too, because not all commits got counted.

The code sometimes looks over engineered / bad, but we were forced to use certain design patterns, even though they were not particularly useful to what we were asked to do.
